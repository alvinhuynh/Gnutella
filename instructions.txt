General way to run client (will act as first node in network):
   python gnutella.py [directory]
where [directory] is the directory that will act is the node's directory.
Files in the [directory]/files folder will be shared on the network.
A [directory]/output.log file will be created to log interactions the node makes.
If files and directories do not already exist, program will generate them


To connect to another node in an existing network on start up:
    python gnutella.py [directory] -i [ip] -p [port#]


To watch the log file while the node is running, run in another terminal:
    tail -c +0 -f [output.log path]


To request a file, after the node is running, enter:
    GET [filename];
Downloaded files will be saved to the [directory]/files folder.
